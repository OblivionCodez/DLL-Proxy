# DLL-Proxy

DLL Proxying / DLL Side-Loading / DLL Hijacking â€“ This method allows you to inject your DLL into offline games without anti-cheat protection. It eliminates the need for a separate injector, ensuring your DLL automatically loads every time the game runs. Keep in mind that different games may use different DLLs, so you will need to adjust the target DLL.
